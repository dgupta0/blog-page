                    <h1>Hi, my name is Deeti and welcome to my blog page.</h1>
                    <p>
                        Through this blog page I will be
                        documenting and describing my programming journey. I will review
                        courseworks I am following, my struggles and insights. I am
                        planning to regularly write about my feelings on learning on
                        programming. </p>

                <h3>My on and off struggle to learn Programming</h3>
                <p>Though on papers I started to learn five years ago,
                    it is only this year, I am finally got my teeth into
                    the game. I started learning front end through Free Code Camp
                    and after completing their second certificate, I moved
                    to Scrimba to learn front end development.
                </p>
                <h3>One good learning so far</h3>
                <p>Before this year, I was learnig to programme
                    through different platforms and courses. I kept pushing
                    myself through knowing I wasn't learning. I wasn't working on
                    personal projects and I was mostly doing follow along coding.
                    I wasted a lot of time that way. However, when I switched to Free Code Camp
                    and Scrimba, they quickly put off the training wheel and I slowly started
                    working on solo projects from scratch. This made me realise how important it
                    is to start writing asap when learning programming. </p>
