                <p>
                    I started my programming journey in 2019. Oh, wait - one disclaimer.

                </p>
                <p>
                    My husband is a passionate computer programmer. Along with that he has all the right ticks on his
                    profile:
                <div class="feature-list">
                    <p>
                        -- One of the best colleges (i.e) IIT. In India getting into IIT is similar to getting into MIT.
                        But only tougher (Acceptance rate of IIT is one percent while for
                        MIT it is eight percent. Please do a simple google search,
                        if you don't believe me). </p>

                    <p> -- Couple of FANG experiences,</p>

                    <p> -- and the best aspect, a great payscale.</p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    So, yeah. His pay scale really inspired me to pursue computer programming as a career. This pursuant
                    had
                    been an on and off journey. I usually don't count this time but I started programming in 2017 with
                    some
                    python book my husband suggested. I also started the python for everybody specialization by Charles
                    Russell
                    Severance. But I think in a month, the interest eroded and quit on both of them.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2019, I left a job in online marketing and advertising and again started pursuing computer
                    programming.
                    Again, I relied on my husband to help me. I again started with books, and again, I left programming!

                </p>
                <p>
                    In mid 2020, I decided to pursue this journey through a University. I thought of getting into a good
                    university programme which could float my boat in that direction. I think my ideology at that time
                    was
                    if I
                    can't do it on my own then following a well structured system would help.
                </p>
                <p>So, I started my computer science journey from a university reference. I understood from the entrance
                    requirements that I need to brush up my math skills. This means going back to calculus and
                    precalculus,
                    which I haven't touched from the past 12 years. In hindsight, I believe that I made a huge mistake.
                    Instead
                    of focusing on learning practical skills, like HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, API's etc or in short-
                    front
                    end development, I spent my time and effort learning skills which are not directly transferable in
                    programming jobs.
                </p>
                <p>I wish I could go back in time and redo those decisions. But it is okay. No good learning and
                    knowledge
                    goes
                    bad.
                </p>
                <p>But still, I wish!
                </p>
                <p>Anyway, the last two to three years were really confusing. I knew what I was doing might be useful
                    for a
                    university curriculum, but that is just about it. Anyway I kept following the entrance requirements,
                    which
                    means taking general introductory CS courses online.
                </p>
                <p>I was preparing myself to start my programming through a University but to my utter surprise, the
                    University
                    rejected me. And I was shattered. Oh, I have been rejected twice by now lol. But the first time was
                    the
                    hardest. In my mind I was already accepted into the programme and have made lofty plans. The
                    rejection
                    was
                    really hard to accept. From that point onwards, I think from mid 2021, I decided to put all my
                    energy
                    into
                    getting accepted. It was more about getting into the programme now for me. So, I decided to take
                    credit
                    courses for Calculus. I also started the university's first year course online, which means learning
                    a
                    functional language name racket. This experience tested my grit and patience. There have been so
                    many
                    times
                    along the way where I believed programming is not for me. I can't do it. But getting into university
                    was
                    everything. So I persevere. It took a lot of time but things started connecting. Though, this entire
                    experience is not useful for jobs, but I don't know, I started enjoying programming, maybe!
                </p>
                <p>Or maybe what I was enjoying more was being busy. This learning experience also made me realize how
                    depressed
                    I was for a very long time. All this experience at least gave me goals and a daily routine to pursue
                    those
                    goals. So, it could be I was just enjoying doing something good.
                </p>
                <p>Of Course all this time spent will never contribute towards an actual job, but what I had was a
                    structure
                    or
                    routine which I unknowingly designed.
                </p>
                <p>I think somewhere in the beginning of 2022, I started having doubts again about my direction. I had
                    already
                    applied again to the university but this time, I was scared. I kept asking myself what will happen
                    if I
                    am
                    rejected again. I know I am learning computer science, but I didn't feel like taking that direction
                    anymore
                    to learn programming, mostly because it wasn't giving me useful programming skills. The pursuit of
                    getting
                    into a degree programme could be longer that I am expecting and it doesn't end afterwards. Even if I
                    get
                    into the programme, I don't know if I will get the best internship or job. This time around I had
                    been
                    really active on reddit too. I was reading posts of people who may have had the best degrees but not
                    necessarily the job they wanted. So, I was really screaming from the inside!
                </p>
                <p>From reading multiple experiences, I had understood that learning front end skills are crucial. You
                    could
                    be
                    with a degree or without degree, but these skills are most important in assessing candidates. Also,
                    thanks
                    to my husband's understanding of the industry, I knew javascript is an important language for jobs.
                    Knowing
                    what I want to learn is clear but I didn't know how to learn it. I tried books and I failed to learn
                    from
                    them. So, I knew I had to find another way to learn. </p>
                <p>For a few nights, I was sleepless. I remember digging google and frankly relied on it to help me from
                    my
                    misery. I remember reading articles about people who were following the Free Code Camp syllabus and
                    learning
                    how to program. FCC was free and easy to get onboard too. I started their syllabus and completed
                    their
                    first
                    certification. I can't explain the kind of confidence it gave me. I was sure from that point that I
                    will
                    follow their syllabus to start my front end development journey.</p>
                <p>While completing their javascript and data structures certificate, one of the best certificates in my
                    opinion, I found Scrimba. Their front end path is bible to learning front end technologies and
                    programming.
                    I am pursuing their front end path and planning to complete it. It is a great resource. I am
                    Currently
                    on
                    Module 7. Scrimba has 14 modules in the front end development path.
                </p>
                <p>Simultaneously, I have started trying my hands on leetcode, all thanks to the FCC javascript course,
                    which
                    gave me confidence to start leetcoding. I am also doing a data structure javascript course through
                    udemy
                    to
                    become better in leetcoding. This journey is slow though. I think it would take me years of
                    consistent
                    practice to really be good at solving problems.</p>
                <p>Right now I am in October of 2022. All in all, I feel that this experience is a ride I will cherish
                    always.
                    It is still a long journey but this time around I am sure of my direction (At Least for now! lol).
                    All I
                    have to do is follow it.
                </p>
                <p>Year 2022, thank you!
